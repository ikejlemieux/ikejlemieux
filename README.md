- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ikejlemieux
- [GFACT Certified](https://www.giac.org/certified-professional/Isaac-LeMieux/233640) 
 - ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in GNU/Linux along with client and server side web development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning NodeJs but i like learning bits and pieces of everything
- I use Arch BTW

- I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
